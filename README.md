Emulate Bearcat (Uniden) BC-780-XLT radio scanner 

The [Uniden BC-780-XLT](https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/BC780XLT) was one of the earliest radio scanners to allow control by computer, via a RS-232 link.  Controlling the scanner is similar to the [Hayes command set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set) in that one writes a simple ASCII string to the device and then read the results.

The BC-780-XLT is old enough to be cheaply available via eBay.  These are fair receivers, although they do suffer from poor intermods (in my case, harmonics from commercial FM broadcasters are a problem).  

There are many popular variations on the BC-780-XLT such as the Radio Shack (add me) all w/similar behavior.

mellow-ferret emulates the features of the [Uniden BC-780-XLT](https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/BC780XLT) i.e. offers programmable search modes, trunking, etc.
