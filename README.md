# mellow-ferret
Emulate a [Bearcat (Uniden) BC-780-XLT](https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/BC780XLT) radio scanner using a [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/).

Still a work in progress, visit later and hopefully I will have more to share.

This project will eventually be distributed as a yocto image for raspberry pi.
